Are you tired of your plants dying despite everything you do to take care of it?
Use grass!
Grass keeps you on top of your watering and fertilisation needs, keeping your
plant happy and alive.
We send you timely notifications for you to water your plants in a timely manner with colourful dashboards with straight-to-the-point visuals so you can spend less time jumping around menus to find what you need.

This app was created by Saumil Anand, James Kuang Zhongchuan, Jeong Wonho, and Loh Hao Yuan under the 2022 Swift Accelerator Programme.
